# Architectural-Elite
Architectural Elite is an Architectural and Engineering Recruitment company that operates globally. The main goal of the website is to attract candidates and getting them to upload their CV. Secondly to attract businesses looking to recruit architectural and engineering candidates.

The current site is outdated and is not responsive. The new site needs to conform to latest design trends and work well on mobile devices. There is also a need to update the brand.

The new site should focus on job search as a main priority and have its own personality with lots of call to actions and clear navigation.
